**On-Time Completion Rate (Gauge)**  
A gauge visual illustrating the percentage of POs completed by or before their forecasted date.

**Spending by Category**  
A bar chart comparing spend across categories (Engineering, Labor, Construction Contract, Material).

**Scatter Plot (Project Risk vs. Spend)**  
X-axis: Project Risk Category  
Y-axis: Total PO Amount  
Bubble size: Number of POs, revealing risk-spend relationships.

**Initial vs. Revised Budget (Column Chart)**  
Side-by-side columns per location, annotated with variance % arrows indicating budget overruns or underruns.

**Monthly Trends (Combo Chart)**  
Columns: PO count per month  
Line: PO dollars  
Inline data labels show both count and dollar values for each month.
